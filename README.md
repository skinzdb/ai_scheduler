Scheduler that assigns comedians and demographics to timeslots in a 5-day timetable.
This timetabling problem can be abstracted to a CSP (constraint satisfaction problem).
For task 1: backtracking search with fail-first heuristics.
For tasks 2 and 3, stochastic local search. Specifically simulated annealing. 
The code for these solutions is in scheduler.py.
